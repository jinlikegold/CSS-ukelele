# CSS-ukelele

This is a fun project from CSS battles (https://cssbattle.dev/) that I used to practice writing efficient CSS and code a design from scratch.

I think it went pretty well; while I could have made the CSS even briefer with less descriptive class names (and gotten a higher score on CSS battles), I chose to err on the side of usability and clarity in my naming.
This is also the first project I've committed via GitHub Desktop! Seems like a great way to go, going forward.
